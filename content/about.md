Hi There!

My name is Dino, I'm a Software Engineer based in Lisbon, Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

I'm currently working at [Remote](https://remote.com), but I've previously worked at
[Onfido](https://onfido.com) and [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com).
Although in my past experiences I've mainly worked with Python I'm now heavily invested in using
Elixir, which I've been loving so far!

In my free time I do like to mess around with synthesizers and music related stuff, I also like to
read and to surf when the time allows it.

Mechanical keyboards are also something I enjoy, I do believe I'm not a crazy keyboard guy but I've
had people tell me once you have more than 2 you're definitely a crazy keyboard guy so I guess I'm
slowly drifting into the dark side of this hobby!

Finally, I'm currently an Elixir mentor at [Exercism](https://exercism.io), which does help me to
get better at explaining concepts and ideas to other people, it also forces me to reinforce some
learnings because you want to make sure you're not giving incorrect information to the people whose
solution you're reviewing! Overall it's a very rewarding experience!

## Where to find me

Feel free to find me in any of these platforms!
